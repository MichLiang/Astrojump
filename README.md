## About
Play as an astronaut who has crash-landed on a foreign planet and is trying to jump his way out. Watch out for sneaky platforms! All sprites were made by me and the awesome background was made by the amazing [@MichLiang](https://github.com/MichLiang).

## Motivation
This project [started off](https://github.com/theRoughCode/AstroJumPy) as an opportunity to learn Python while implementing a game idea I had. However, as the game scaled up, I realized that the code base became too messy and functions weren't modular enough. Trying to avoid spaghetti code, I restarted the project in Unity and C#.
